                <p>Every word in English can be classified as one of eight parts of speech. The term part of speech refers to the role a word plays in a sentence. And like in any workplace or on any TV show with an ensemble cast, these roles were designed to work together.

                    Read on to learn about the different parts of speech that the words we use every day fall into, and how we use them together to communicate ideas clearly.</p>
                <div id="Nouns" class="section scrollspy"></div>
                <h3>Nouns</h3>
                <p>A noun is a word that names a person, place, concept, or object. Basically, anything that names a “thing” is a noun, whether you’re talking about a basketball court, San Francisco, Cleopatra, or self-preservation.

                    Nouns fall into two categories: common nouns and proper nouns. Common nouns are general names for things, like planet and game show. Proper nouns are names or titles for specific things, like Jupiter and Jeopardy!</p>
           <p>Noun is any of the particular person, place, thing or idea in a sentence</p>
           <button class="waves-effect waves-light btn orange darken-3">Examples</button>
                <br><br>
                <img src="Images/Img2 Nouns.JPG" alt="" class="responsive-img">

            <p>Nouns often have articles (the, a, or an) before them in a sentence, but not always. Sometimes you’ll see adjectives like red or some before nouns. Aside from the first word in a sentence, if a word is capitalized, then it’s most likely a proper noun, such as a person’s name.</p>
            <div id="Pronouns" class="section scrollspy"></div>
            <h3>Pronouns</h3>
           <p>Pronouns are words you substitute for specific nouns when the reader or listener already knows which specific noun you’re referring to.

            You might say, “Jennifer was supposed to be here at eight,” then follow it with “She’s always late; next time I’ll tell her to be here a half hour earlier.”
            
            Instead of saying Jennifer’s name three times in a row, you substituted she and her, and your sentences remained grammatically correct.</p>
            <img src="Images/Img3 Pronouns.JPG" alt="" class="responsive-img">
            <p class="flow-text">Main List of Personal Pronouns</p>
        <p>When you think of pronouns, you most likely think first of personal pronouns. Personal pronouns are pronouns that change form based on their grammatical person—that is, based on whether they refer to the person speaking or writing (the first person), the person or thing being spoken to (the second person), or the person or thing being spoken about (the third person).</p>

        <p>Note: In English grammar, pronouns are a type of generic noun that can represent any other noun. Their job is to make communication faster and more efficient because you don’t have to repeat the same word over and over again.</p>
        <p class="flow-text">Relative Pronouns</p>
        <p>Relative pronouns are another class of pronouns. They connect relative clauses to independent clauses. Often, they introduce additional information about something mentioned in the sentence.</p>

        <h3>Adjectives</h3>
        <p>Adjectives are the words that describe nouns. Think about your favorite movie. How would you describe it to a friend who’s never seen it?

            You might say the movie was funny, engaging, well-written, or suspenseful. When you’re describing the movie with these words, you’re using adjectives. An adjective can go right before the noun it’s describing (“I have a black dog”), but it doesn’t have to. Sometimes, adjectives are at the end of a sentence (“My dog is black”).</p>

         <div id="Verbs" class="section scrollspy"></div>
          <h3>Verbs</h3>
          <p>Verbs are words that represent actions that are external (run, jump, work) and internal (love, think, consider). Without verbs, you can’t do anything, you can’t feel anything—you can’t even be anything.  

            As the heart of sentences and clauses, verbs show what the subject is doing or feeling, even if they’re just existing. Verbs are also the only type of word that’s absolutely necessary to make a sentence. Not even nouns, which represent things, need to be in every sentence. </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s7 push-s5"><div class="card-panel green darken-1 white-text center">Stative verbs describe a position or state of being that you can’t see, but exists anyway. While they don't perform any visible action, notice that they're typically followed by a direct object.</div></div>
            <div class="col s5 pull-s7"><div class="card-panel green darken-1 white-text center">Action verbs describe actions that someone can do or demonstrate. Most verbs are action verbs. </div></div>
            <div class="col s5 pull-s7"><div class="card-panel green darken-1 white-text center">Most verbs are regular verbs — verbs that only add -d or -ed in their past tense form. </div></div>

          <h3>Adverbs</h3>
          <p>An adverb is a word that describes an adjective, a verb, or another adverb.An adverb is a word or an expression that generally modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, clause, preposition, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as how, in what way, when, where, to what extent.  </p>

            <div class="col s6">
                <div class="flow-text">Adverbs vs. adjectives</div>
                <p>While adverbs can modify verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and entire sentences, adjectives can only modify nouns and pronouns (e.g., “the red door”).</p>

            <div class="col s6">
                <div class="flow-text ">Adverbs vs. adjectives</div>
                <p>Adverbs are often formed by adding “-ly” to the end of an adjective. However, adverbs can also be formed from adjectives in other ways, depending on the ending.”</p>

        </div>

            <div class="flow-text blue darken-2 white-text center">Types of Adverbs</div>  
    <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Manner</h5>
    <p>An adverb of manner describes how an action is performed or how something happens. In most cases, adverbs of manner occur after the main verb. Ex. 
        Jessie read quietly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Degree</h5>
    <p>Adverbs of degree are used to qualify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs by expressing extent or degree. Some common adverbs of degree include: “extremely,” “absolutely,” “slightly,” “quite,” and “enough.”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Place</h5>
    <p>An adverb of place provides information about the location of an action (e.g., position, distance, and direction). Adverbs of place typically occur after the main verb of a sentence. Ex. Confetti was thrown everywhere.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Time</h5>
    <p>Adverbs of time (e.g., “yesterday,” “today,” “tomorrow”) describe when something happens. They are typically placed at the end of a sentence.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Frequency</h5>
    <p>Adverbs of frequency describe how often something happens. They can be divided into two categories based on how specific they are. Ex. Anna always works on Saturdays.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>Adverbs of Purpose</h5>
    <p>Adverbs of purpose (also called adverbs of reason) help to explain why something is the case. Many adverbs of purpose function as conjunctive adverbs. Ex. Since you’re busy, I’ll call back later.</p>
  </div>
        <div class="flow-text">Conjunctive adverbs</div>
        <p>Conjunctive adverbs (also called linking adverbs) connect two independent clauses by turning the second clause into an adverbial modifier of the first. They can be used as transition words to introduce consequence, condition, comparison, contrast, and clarification.</p>
           <br>
           <div id="Prepositions" class="section scrollspy"></div>
           <h3>Prepositions</h3>
           <p>A preposition is a word or group of words used before a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase to show direction, time, place, location, spatial relationships, or to introduce an object. Prepositions indicate direction, time, location, and spatial relationships, as well as other abstract types of relationships. </p>

           <p>A conjunction is a word that is used to connect words, phrases, and clauses. There are many conjunctions in the English language, but some common ones include and, or, but, because, for, if, and when. There are three basic types of conjunctions: coordinating, subordinating, and correlative.</p>
